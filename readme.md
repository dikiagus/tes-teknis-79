# üèÜ 48 Hour Backend Technical Challenge

The backend solution is an <b>API</b> for managing employees with just 3 controllers, using <u>MongoDB</u> for persistence, request validation with <u>express-validator</u>, and  <b>try-catch</b> blocks to make the application understandable and easy to debug. 

> I personally used a <u>Mongo Docker image</u>  and <u>Render</u> for deployment!

### Github Workflow
* `db-image`: branch is responsible for creating the mongodb container which serves as the database.
* `feature`: branch will contain all project requirements divided into sub branches and labeled with `enhancements`.
* `release`: branch is merged into the main branch when the work is tested and completed.

> More documentation is included in the issues tab.

### Playing with the solution

* To build the application (generate the javascript dist) :

`npm run build`

<hr>

* To run the application in the development mode :

`npm run dev`

<hr>

* To run the mongo docker container  (MongoDB database in a container created with few commands and isolated form the OS):

```
// navigate to docker compose
> cd ./db 

// run docker compose file in detached mode
> sudo docker compose up -d

// open the mongo shell to interacte with the database
> docker exec -it personal-mongo-database mongosh

YOURE INSIDE THE CONTAINER NOW YOU CAN LIST DATABASES, USE ONE, DO ANY CRUD OPERATIONS...

    # list all databases
    > show dbs
    
    # use a specific database
    > use db_name

    # see all the collections of the database selected
    > show collections

    # list all documents in a collection
    > db.db_name.find()

```

### Demos of the backend application in action XD

> the test is performed using `Thunder Client`

* POST /employees: Add a new employee:
